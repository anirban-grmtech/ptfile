1. Saving to DB is slow

2. I open "add form" and enter "jai kali ma" and then i close the add form by pressign escape. In the table that row should not have change and discontinue - DONE

3. When I hit submit the form should still be available to enter more data.

4. Below the form create another form called "Sending data to server" there you can show the data sent to the server. - DONE

5. Change query -> on client side update the ROW_END and for the new row update the state. - DONE

6. discontinue -> On click give a confirm button with space for entering text. https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/message-box#prompt - DONE (Note: need to discuss vikas sir regarding 'how to manage discontinue notes')

7. multi discontinue -> no comment to be added.

8. Form field focus using v-on
