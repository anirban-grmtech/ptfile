import { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'
const { v1: uuidv1 } = require('uuid')

/* Giving a numeric ID to each row
    Why?
    Better performance. Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10639488/faster-to-access-numeric-property-by-string-or-integer  
    How?
      Solution comes from cue on slack given on 10th July 2020
        The closure passed into this.uid(() => intUniqueID()) simply invokes the closure when the model is instructed to generate a uid. The callback simply needs to return a value. 
        In itâ€™s simplest form, all you need for a primitive value is:
        let count = 0
        const intUniqueID = () => ++count
        this.uid(() => intUniqueID())
      */

let count = 0
const intUniqueID = () => ++count

export default class reminders extends Model {
  static entity = 'rem'

  /*  What should be the primary key?
    
     Option1: uuid -> Not possible since there are duplicate uuid as this is temporal DB
                      if there are 10 data rows and 2 are duplicate then entities will only get 8 entries.
    
     Option2: composite primary key. 
            ['uuid', 'ROW_START'] // Ref: https://vuex-orm.org/guide/model/defining-models.html#primary-key
            
            Finding data from primary key is much faster then finding data by running a loop over all the data rows.
            
            Update with primary key:
                 ormRem.update({
                  where: uniqueRowID              // vuex-orm knows that it needs to match with primary key
                  data: {
                    remDesc: pEvent,
                    },
                  })


            update with composite primary ley:
             ormRem.update({
              where: [remUUID, this.reminderRowStart],    // The index is bigger and it will take longer to match
              data: {
                remDesc: pEvent,
                },
              })      
                

     Option3: Let vuex-orm give auto generated string primary key of auto increment numbers like $uid1

     Option 4: Generate a numerical ID

     Choice made in July 2020: Option 4
